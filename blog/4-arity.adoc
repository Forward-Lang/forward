=== Signature (logic) - Wikipedia footnote:[<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signature_(logic)>]

> Formally, a (single-sorted) signature can be defined as a triple σ = (S~func~, S~rel~, ar)
> S~func~ and S~rel~ are disjoint sets
>
> * function symbols (examples: +, ×, 0, 1)
> * relation symbols or predicates (examples: ≤, ∈)
> * a function ar: S~func~ ∪ S~rel~ → ℕ which assigns a natural number called arity to every function or relation symbol

> A signature with no function symbols is called a relational signature +
> A signature with no relation symbols is called an algebraic signature

=== Defining arity

[source,math]
----
f(x) = x + 5          <1>
g(x,y) = x + y        <2>
h(x1,x2...xn) = ∑ xn  <3>
----

<1> function f of arity 1
<2> function g of arity 2
<3> function h of arity n

In a stack-based language:

[source,forth]
----
: add  ( a b -- c ) + ;           <1>
: add5 ( a -- c ) 5 + ;           <2>
----

<1> word `add` of arity 2
<2> word `add5` of arity 1
