== Signature (logic) - Wikipedia footnote:[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signature_(logic)]

> Formally, a (single-sorted) signature can be defined as a triple σ = (Sfunc, Srel, ar)
> Sfunc and Srel are disjoint sets
>
> * function symbols (examples: +, ×, 0, 1)
> * relation symbols or predicates (examples: ≤, ∈)
> * a function ar: Sfunc {\displaystyle \cup } Srel → {\displaystyle \mathbb {N} } which assigns a natural number called arity to every function or relation symbol

> A signature with no function symbols is called a relational signature
> A signature with no relation symbols is called an algebraic signature
