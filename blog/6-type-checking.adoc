== {subtitle}

There are some terms related to what I'm about to discuss that don't quite capture the orthogonality that I'm trying to portray here.
Statuc vs dynamic typing, duck typing, dependent types, property checking.

.Name checking
```factor
( Number Number -- Number )
: add + ;
```

.Property checking
```factor
( isNumber? isNumber? -- isNumber? )
: add + ;
```

.Depedent Property checking
```factor
( isNumber? isNumber? -- isNumber? )
: add + ;
```

dependent, because it actually depends on the arguments
