== {subtitle}

I would actually argue that the definition from Wikipedia isn't complete.
(𝐍, 𝚺, 𝐏, 𝐒) is just the data,
 → is the operator over that data. 
Just as the natural numbers alone don't do much,
 but addition over the natural numbers,
 all of the sudden has much more meaning/use. 

.Integers under Addition
[example]
====
The set of integers under addition (Z,+) forms an abelian group,
 that has the property of closure, associativity and commutativity;
 as well as having an identity element and inverse element.
====

Additionally in the above notation,
 concatenation is implicit (by the juxtaposition of terminals/non-terminals)
 and alternation is sort of explicit (by defining another production rule with the same non-terminal on the LHS).

.Alternation and Ambiguity
[NOTE]
====
The problem with alternation is that it makes the grammar ambiguous:
 if I have two production rule with the same non-terminal on the LHS,
 which one should I take?
Parsing expression grammar solve this by using ordered choice, ie pick the first matching choice.
====

In BNF alternation is explicit (with `|`), while in EBNF both alternation and concatenation is explicit (with `|` and `,`).

I would argue that there is yet another operator missing and that is the expansion of non-terminals on the RHS of a production rule.
