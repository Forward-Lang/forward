I would actually argue that the definition from Wikipedia isn't complete.
  footnote:[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_grammar]
(𝐍, 𝚺, 𝐏, 𝐒) is just the data,
 → is the operator over that data. 
Just as the natural numbers alone don't do much,
 but addition over the natural numbers,
 all of the sudden has much more meaning/use. 

.Integers under Addition
[example]
====
The set of integers under addition (Z,+) forms an abelian group,
 that has the property of closure, associativity and commutativity;
 as well as having an identity element and inverse element.
====

Additionally in this notation:

----
S → aaB            <1> <2>
S → abc            <2>
B → c
----

<1> concatenation is implicit (by the juxtaposition of terminals/non-terminals), and
<2> alternation is sort of explicit (by defining another production rule with the same non-terminal on the LHS).

In BNF alternation is explicit (with `|`), while in EBNF both alternation and concatenation is explicit (with `|` and `,`).

.Alternation and Ambiguity
[NOTE]
====
The problem with alternation is that it makes the grammar ambiguous:
 if I have two production rule with the same non-terminal on the LHS,
 which one should I take?
Parsing expression grammar solve this by using ordered choice, ie pick the first matching choice.
====

I would argue that there is yet another operator missing and that is the expansion of non-terminals on the RHS of a production rule.

   P ⇒ Q ?

---

Thinking about it further;
 → probably isn't an opertor,
 rather it is an relation.
Compare it to the equivalence relation `=` (ie, "equals") in normal algebra:

.Equals in normal algebra
[example]
----
y = 1 + x    ⇒ 6
x = 2 + 3    ⇒ 5
----

.Production rule in formal grammars
[example]
----
S → aA   ⇒ abc
A → bc   ⇒ bc
----

Luckily for us,
 just because a symbol is a relation rather than an operator,
 doesn't mean it doesn't have any properties.

For equality:
 footnote:[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equality_(mathematics)#Basic_properties]
 
* Substitution property: For any quantities a and b and any expression F(x), if a = b, then F(a) = F(b) (provided that both sides are well-formed).
** Some specific examples of this are:
** For any real numbers a, b, and c, if a = b, then a + c = b + c (here, F(x) is x + c);
** For any real numbers a, b, and c, if a = b, then a − c = b − c (here, F(x) is x − c);
** For any real numbers a, b, and c, if a = b, then ac = bc (here, F(x) is xc);
** For any real numbers a, b, and c, if a = b and c is not zero, then a/c = b/c (here, F(x) is x/c).
* Reflexive property: For any quantity a, a = a.
* Symmetric property: For any quantities a and b, if a = b, then b = a.
* Transitive property: For any quantities a, b, and c, if a = b and b = c, then a = c.

In a type-0 grammar:
 footnote:[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chomsky_hierarchy#The_hierarchy]

* `a → a` or `S → S` might be valid, which is the Reflexive property.
* `S → a` and `a → S` might be valid, which is the Symmetric property.
* `S → a` and `a → B` and `B → c` then `S → c` might be valid, which is the Transitive property.
** `S → B` and `B → a` then `S → a`. This is valid even in type-3 grammars (regular grammars)
