=== Classics

<<sicp>> is a classical book that is often recommended.
It was used by MIT for their undergraduate course, introduction to computer science, for several years.
However, this is its weakness; by trying to cover such a wide range of topics, it doesn't cover anything exceptionally well. 

=== Forth books

I would recommend <<sf>>, regardless of whether you're 5 or 80.
This book is concise and to the point,
 and introduces in a really intuitive way concepts whithin computing that aren't neccessarily obvious.
For historical background I would recommend <<pol>>,
 written by Charles Moore slighty after he had created the first versions of forth.
It covers some subjects not covered by <<sf>>.
For instance,
 I would argue that chapter 7 goes into territory that would nowadays be covered by books on operating system development.
Another useful book is <<mf>>, for those writing or porting an assembly forth,
 ie forths using assembly (or even machine-code) rather than a higher-level language.
