symbol, name of binary operation, commutative? {fn_commute}

+,addition, yes
×,multiplication, yes

.unary inverses

symbol, name of binary operation, commutative? {fn_commute}, name of unary inverse 

−, substraction, no, negation {fn_neg}
÷, division, no, reciprocal {fn_div}
,===

Subtraction and divistion as binary operations aren't commutative,
  ie `a - b ≠ b - a` and `a ÷ b ≠ b ÷ a`.
That's why forward uses the unary operations (which are inverses).

negation "creates" the negative numbers, while
reciprocal "creates" fractions
