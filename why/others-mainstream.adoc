= Present language paradigm: and itâ€™s constructs 

1. Imperative: 
    * if else then
    * while, do until, for loops
2. Functional
    * map, filter, reduce
    * curry, partial application 
3. Object oriented 

= Implementing these constructs: from scratch 

* if else then: short circuit
* loops: goto or recursion
* map, filter, reduce: recursion
* curry, partial application

= Present programming languages: and their applications

1. Imperative: 
    * C
2. Functional
    * JavaScript 
3. Object oriented
