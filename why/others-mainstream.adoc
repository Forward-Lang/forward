= Programming Paradigms: and their constructs 
:toc:
:source-highlighter: pygments

The three main programming paradigms in widespread use today are:

. Imperative
. Functional
. Object oriented 

Each paradigm has different a different approach to how they solve problems.

.Here's a summary of the main concepts related to each paradigm:

1. Imperative: 
    * if else then
    * while, do until, for loops
2. Functional
    * map, filter, reduce
    * curry, partial application 
3. Object oriented 

We are also going to implement these constructs from scratch

* if else then: short circuit
* loops: goto or recursion
* map, filter, reduce: recursion
* curry, partial application


****
we are going to present these constructs in bash and javascript.
