= Programming Paradigms: and their constructs 

The three main programming paradigms in widespread use today are:

. Imperative: 
. Functional
. Object oriented 

Each paradigm has different a different approach to how they solve problems.
Here's a summary of the main concepts related to each paradigm:

1. Imperative: 
    * if else then
    * while, do until, for loops
2. Functional
    * map, filter, reduce
    * curry, partial application 
3. Object oriented 


== Imperative

    * if else then
    * while, do until, for loops


[source,bash]
----
# bash
if true then echo "it is true"; else echo "it is not true";
for i in 1 2 3 4 5; echo $i; done
----

[source,javascript]
----
// javascript
if true then doThis() else doThat;
----



= Implementing these constructs: from scratch 

* if else then: short circuit
* loops: goto or recursion
* map, filter, reduce: recursion
* curry, partial application

= Present programming languages: and their applications

1. Imperative: 
    * C
2. Functional
    * JavaScript 
3. Object oriented 
    * JavaScript
