A stack-based programming language

toc::[]

## Goals

* Literate programming
* Debugging
** Read Eval Print Loop
* Denotational semantics
* Axiomatic semantics
** <<Hoare>> triples: Pre- and Post-conditions. Possibly also while-conditions aka invariants.
** <<Dependent>> types
* Stupidly Simple Grammar
* Pattern Matching
** Macros
** Intuitive Grammar (on layer 2, after macros are applied)
** Code as Data, but not Data as Code.

### Inspiration sources

Currently being inspired mainly by:

* UI/UX of <<factor>>, <<pharo>> and especially <<:r4>>
** Holistic approach of Lisp Machines, Oberon, Smalltalk, Forth
* Numerical semantics of <<APL>>
* Textual semantics of the unix shell.

## Grammar

Unfortunately stack-based/concatenative languages don't really have a grammar, as there is no syntax.
These languages are made up of words. 

## Denotational semantics


### Informal definitions

* Atoms/Elements:
** Booleans
** Characters
** Numbers
* Arrays
** Bitarrays
** Strings
** Vectors
** Matrixes

### Formal definitions
