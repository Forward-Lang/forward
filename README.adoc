|===========
| Mission | To create a programming language that is simple enough to be understood fully under a week, but with **powerful enough mental models** to allow for its effective use and application within different problem domains.
| Vision | That due to its simplicity it sees widespread use whithin its problem domains, remaining in the background, out of the way, ready to be used. Ubiquitous like the shell, but as effective as a scalpel, not a <<chainsaw>>! 
| Values |

* "Correct" mental mapping of models to the problem domains. (Once learnt,) it should stay out of the way, you should focus on solving your problem, not fixing your tools.
* Simplicity, through the removal of unnecessities. Being <<simplex>>, by choosing to untangle and compose concepts rather than to interleave them.
* "Simply Correct", easy to use tools to formally specify and verfiy implementations
* Fast (enough), no one likes a blunt, dull tool. Make it sharp, make it fast.

== Quotes

.From a French writer, poet and aviator:

"In anything at all,
perfection is finally attained not when there is no longer anything to add,
but when there is no longer anything to take away,
when a body has been stripped down to its nakedness."
-- Antoine de Saint Exup√©ry, Terre des Hommes (1939)

.From an abstract expressionist painter:

"The ability to simplify means to eliminate the unnecessary so that the necessary may speak."
-- Hans Hofmann

.From a computer science professor:

"If you cannot grok the overall structure of a program while taking a shower,
you are not ready to code it."
-- Richard E. Pattis

.From a pioneer in computer science:

"The purpose of abstraction is not to be vague,
but to create a new semantic level in which one can be absolutely precise."
-- Edsger W. Dijkstra, The Humble Programmer (1972)

.From a software engineer:

"Walking on water and developing software from a specification are easy if both are frozen."
-- Edward V. Berard, Essays on object-oriented software engineering (1993)

== Goals

* Literate programming
* Debugging
** Read Eval Print Loop
* Denotational semantics
* Axiomatic semantics
** <<Hoare-triples>>: Pre- and Post-conditions. Possibly also while-conditions aka invariants.
** <<Dependent-types>>
* Stupidly Simple Grammar
* Pattern Matching
** Macros
** Intuitive Grammar (on layer 2, after macros are applied)
** Code as Data, but not Data as Code.

=== Inspiration sources

Currently being inspired mainly by:

* UI/UX of <<factor>>, <<pharo>> and especially <<r4>>
** Holistic approach of Lisp Machines, Oberon, Smalltalk, Forth
* Numerical semantics of <<APL>>
* Textual semantics of the unix shell.

== Waterfall process

. Integration Requirements
. Feature Design
. Properties
. Specification
. Implementation
. Verification
. Maintenance 

We are applying the above "<<waterfall>>" process to each Domain Specific Language,
 in order to somewhat avoid <<analysis-paralysis>> and to have something to show.
This means that forward as a programming language will grow incrementally,
 as new vocabularies are added.
